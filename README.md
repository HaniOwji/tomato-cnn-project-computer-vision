# Tomato CNN Project (Computer Vision)

University coursework project: Tomato leaf image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project context
This is an academic project for a Computer Vision module.

## What this project does
- Loads and preprocesses an image dataset
- Trains a CNN model for image classification
- Evaluates model performance (basic metrics and plots)
- Saves/prints results inside the notebook

## Files
- tomato-cnn-project.ipynb: main notebook
- .gitignore: ignored files/folders for clean version control

## Dataset
The dataset is not included in this repository.

Add the dataset source link here:
- Dataset source: <PASTE_DATASET_LINK_HERE>

Notes:
- Do not upload large datasets to GitHub.
- Keep the dataset local or use a cloud drive link if needed.

## How to run
Option 1: Google Colab (recommended)
1. Open tomato-cnn-project.ipynb on GitHub
2. Click "Open in Colab" (or upload the notebook to Colab)
3. Update dataset paths inside the notebook
4. Run all cells from top to bottom

Option 2: Run locally
1. Install Python (3.9+ recommended)
2. Install dependencies (create requirements.txt if you do not have it yet):
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Start Jupyter:
   jupyter notebook
4. Open and run:
   tomato-cnn-project.ipynb
