# Tomato CNN Project (Computer Vision)

University coursework project: Tomato leaf image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Project context
This is an academic project for a Computer Vision module.

## What this project does
- Loads and preprocesses an image dataset
- Trains a CNN model for image classification
- Evaluates model performance (basic metrics and plots)
- Saves/prints results inside the notebook

## How to run
Google Colab (recommended)
1. Open tomato-cnn-project.ipynb on GitHub
2. Click "Open in Colab" (or upload the notebook to Colab)
3. Update dataset paths inside the notebook
4. Run all cells from top to bottom
